the signed 32 bit range is [-2^31, 2^31 -1]
  ex: 2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647

-if the number is a single digit, then return that same digit
-if the number's length is greater 10, return 0
-keep the number's positive or negative value
-if you are given a number that ends in 0, you do not return that 0 as the starting returned number

ex:
 1 = 1

ex:
  12345678901 = 0

ex:
  130 = 31.

ex:
  -90 = -9

Potential solutions:
1. take the number and convert to a string
2. split the string by each character so that each stringified number is in its own element
3. iterate through array and put each element in front of a new array
4. turn the new result array into a string
5. turn the string back into a number
6. return that number
