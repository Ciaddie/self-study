I will create a local array of random integers. With those integers I will then set the first element to be the smallest integer. Then I will iterate through array and compare the current element with the smallest. IF the current is smaller than the smallest, then I will swap the elements positions. When the iterations are finished, the smallest element SHOULD be in the front. I will then splice the array and take the swapped element and push it to a new array that holds the sorted elements. I will mantain an outer loop running the loop that is concentrating on the array until there is nothing in the original array. I have terrible run on sentences here but I am a software engineer, not an english major.
