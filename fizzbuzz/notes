inputs: none
outputs: open for interpretation... a string? an array? an object?

- I think i will try to make an object to clearly outline each number and how they produce either fizz, buzz, fizzbuzz, or none.

- this may not be the exact way that the problem is presented. However, I chose what I thought was fitting for me- considering the fact that I will not dig too deep into this problem for fear of accidently reading the answer

Potential solutions:
- create a result object to hold every number.
- create a for loop to go from 1-100
  - test for BOTH 5 and 3
  - test for 5
  - test for 3
  - if all else fails, value of current key/number fails
- return result object
